# Coding-Portfolio

Hello prospective employer! This is a collection of some of the coding projects that I've worked on! Please peruse to your content

The most involved coding project that I worked on was during the majority of my MS at Northwestern University while doing independent research under Michael Rubenstein. This in the 'Swarm Optimization' folder written in C++. While I did not create most of the infrastructure of the simulation, I did design the algorithm that the robots run (ie. the code that the actual physical robots would run) and the resource generation and collection code (so I wrote virtually all of kilobot.cpp and roughly half of main.cpp, with minor contributions to some of the other files)

Other fun projects were 'Droplet Simulation' in the 'MATLAB' folder, in which I studied the dynamics of water droplet bouncing off of vibrating surfaces by simulating them in MATLAB.

Perhaps the most fun is 'decipher:' in the 'Python' folder, which cracks the decipherment of a provided file using forward backward and Viterbi algorithms
