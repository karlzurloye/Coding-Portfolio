# Coding-Portfolio

Hello prospective employer! This is a collection of some of the coding projects that I've worked on! Please peruse to your content

The most involved coding project that I worked on was during the majority of my MS at Northwestern University while doing independent research under Michael Rubenstein. This is in C++ in the 'Swarm Optimization' folder. While I did not create most of the infrastructure of the simulation, I did design the algorithm that the robots run (ie. the code that the actual physical robots would run) and the resource generation and collection code (so I wrote virtually all of kilobot.cpp and roughly half of main.cpp, with minor contributions to some of the other files)
